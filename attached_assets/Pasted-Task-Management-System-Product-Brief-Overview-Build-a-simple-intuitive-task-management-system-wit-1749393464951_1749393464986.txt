Task Management System - Product Brief
Overview
Build a simple, intuitive task management system with visual project organization and drag-and-drop functionality. The system should be minimal, elegant, and frictionless for daily task management.
Core Structure
The application follows a strict 2-level hierarchy:
Project (Card)
├── Milestone 1
│   ├── Task A
│   ├── Task B
│   └── Task C
├── Milestone 2
│   ├── Task D
│   └── Task E
└── Milestone 3
    └── Task F
Key Features
Project Cards

Each project displays as a Trello-style card
Clean, minimal card design with project title
Cards should be visually distinct and organized
Optional due dates displayed prominently on project cards

Milestone System

Milestones act as major checkpoints within each project
Displayed as columns or sections under each project card
Clear visual separation between milestones
Optional due dates for milestones with subtle visual indicators

Task Management

Tasks are the smallest unit (no subtasks allowed)
Tasks belong to specific milestones within projects
Simple task creation with minimal required information
Optional due dates for tasks with visual indicators

Drag & Drop Functionality
Priority Requirements:

Drag tasks between milestones within the same project
Reorder tasks within a milestone (up/down)
Smooth, responsive drag interactions
Visual feedback during drag operations

User Experience Requirements
Visual Design

Clean, minimal interface
Generous whitespace
Consistent spacing and typography
Subtle shadows/borders for card definition
Intuitive iconography

Interaction Design

One-click task creation
Inline editing for task names
Hover states for interactive elements
Clear visual hierarchy (Project > Milestone > Task)

Performance

Instant visual feedback for all interactions
Smooth animations for drag/drop
Fast loading and rendering

Technical Considerations
Core Technologies

Modern web framework (React recommended)
Drag-and-drop library (react-beautiful-dnd or similar)
Local storage for data persistence initially
Responsive design for desktop/tablet use

Data Structure
javascript{
  projects: [
    {
      id: "project-1",
      name: "Project Name",
      dueDate: "2024-12-31", // Optional
      milestones: [
        {
          id: "milestone-1",
          name: "Milestone Name",
          dueDate: "2024-12-15", // Optional
          tasks: [
            {
              id: "task-1",
              name: "Task Name",
              dueDate: "2024-12-10", // Optional
              completed: false
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Success Metrics

Time to create a new task: < 5 seconds
Time to reorganize tasks: < 10 seconds
Zero learning curve for basic operations
Frictionless daily usage

Out of Scope (Keep Simple)

Complex task dependencies
Team collaboration features
Time tracking
File attachments
Task priorities/labels
More than 2 levels of hierarchy

Development Timeline
Target: Complete functional prototype within 1-2 development sessions
Priority Order

Basic project/milestone/task structure
Task creation and editing
Drag-and-drop between milestones
Task reordering within milestones
Visual polish and animations
Data persistence

Key User Flows
Creating a Task

Click "+" or "Add Task" in desired milestone
Type task name inline
Press Enter to save

Moving Tasks

Click and drag task
Visual indicators show valid drop zones
Drop in new milestone or position
Immediate visual update

Setting Due Dates

Click date icon or "Add Due Date" on project/milestone/task
Quick date picker appears
Select date or clear existing date
Visual indicator updates immediately

Project Organization

Projects displayed as distinct cards
Milestones visible as columns/sections within cards
Tasks listed clearly under appropriate milestones

The end result should feel like a digital whiteboard that's as intuitive as moving sticky notes around, but with the structure needed for proper project management.
